<h1>Introduction to the Full Stack Developer tools</h1>
<p>This is my small page dedicated to learning the first three coding languages; HTML5, CSS and Javascript. Watch the videos to learn the foundations of these languages</p>

    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>The first form of coding i was introduced to and perhaps the easiest to learn.</p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>The second form of coding we will look at is CSS, this version of coding focuses on the stylish elements of websites and adds more flair to your projects.</p>

    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>The final form of coding is Javascript. Probably the hardest to learn but focuses on the functional elements of a webpage and thus one of the more important coding languages.</p>
